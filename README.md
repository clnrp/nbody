Solving the n-body problem interacting gravitationally using Python

It's used Euler method improved and Runge-Kutta method of 4th order to find numeric solutions.

In the links below the code was used to simulate some situations, to compare the numerical result with that of the analytical solution of a body launched on the surface of a planet, and of a satellite in the orbit of a planet, was also carried out the simulation where the analytical solution is not viable, with several bodies interacting gravitationally and also two systems of several bodies in a collision course.
